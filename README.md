- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors.

1. Prioritize tasks: When you are working on a project, it is essential to determine which tasks are the most important and which can be completed later. By prioritizing your tasks in this way, you can ensure that you focus on the critical aspects of the project and not get sidetracked by less significant details. Use task management tools, such as Trello or Asana, to help keep track of your priorities. 
 2. Plan ahead: Planning is crucial when it comes to programming. Before starting a new project or a difficult task, take some time to think through the steps involved and create a plan.This will ensure you have a clear idea of what needs to happen and can avoid getting stuck or wasting time on unnecessary tasks. Break down your plan into smaller, manageable steps and prioritize them accordingly.  
3. Stay organized: A clean and organized codebase is a joy to work with and will save you time and frustration in the long run. Follow best practices for version control, using tools like Git, commit your code regularly, organize your files and directories logically, use concise variable and function names, follow coding conventions,and keep your editor setup convenient and efficient. These practices will make your work more enjoyable and help prevent errors and confusion.
